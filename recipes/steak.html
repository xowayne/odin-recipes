    <h3>Medium Rare Pan Seared Steak Recipe</h3>

    <P> This is one of my personal favorite steak recipes of all time.
        A pan seared medium rare steak provides all the natural, juicy flavors
        expected of prime meat. We will be enhancing these tones by adding 
        flavorful seasoning and a mouth watering, buttery sear leaving you 
        speechless!
